## About cs50
CS50 is a openware course from Havard University and taught by David J. Malan

Introduction to the computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, security, and software engineering. Languages include C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development).
It helps you understand a lot of the core CS concepts, and then gives you the confidence to build cool projects. It is very difficult and fast-paced, but if you stick with it, I think it will pay off.
Thank you for all CS50 stuff.
